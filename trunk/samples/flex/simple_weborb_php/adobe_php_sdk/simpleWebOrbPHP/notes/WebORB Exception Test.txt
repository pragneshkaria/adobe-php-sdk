The 1.1 release also has code to handle server-side error propagation. If your
php code throws an exception, WebORB will serialize it as a fault and your
client-side fault handler will be triggered. So if your PHP code has the
following:

public function testException()
{
throw new Exception( "I am an exception" );
}

Then on the client side you could have:

remoteObject = new RemoteObject();
remoteObject.destination = "your-destination";
remoteObject.addEventListener("fault", onFault);
remoteObject.testException();

public function onFault (event:FaultEvent):void
{
// will display "i am an exception"
Alert.show(event.fault.faultString, 'Error');
}


Please let me know if it still does not work for you.
