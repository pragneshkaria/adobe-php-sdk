If you want to build the SDK, do the following.

1.  Export the project from SVN. From Eclipse, go to SVN Repository view, 
    right click on "trunk", select Export...
2.  Export it to c:/temp/php_ria_sdk_by_adobe/
3.  Copy the /libraries directory over, or download the libraries that you need:
	1.  AMFPHP http://www.amfphp.org/ -> This goes in the libraries/amfphp/ directory.
		(ie. gateway.php is in libraries/amfphp/)
	2.  WebORB http://www.themidnightcoders.org -> This goes in the libraries/weborb/Weborb/ directory. 
	 	(ie. ORBHttpHandler.php is in libraries/weborb/Weborb/)
