Updating to include a new sample: samples/flex/simple_flex_xmlphp  This sample shows connecting to a PHP script that outputs XML, without the need for a database.
Fixing some problems with files missing from amfphp/ directory (gateway.php, advancedsettings.php and debuggateway.php).
Updated LICENSE.TXT to assign copyright to Adobe.  Individual libraries retain their copyright information, this applies only to the SDK as a whole.
