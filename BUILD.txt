If you want to build the SDK, do the following.

1.  Export the project from SVN. From Eclipse, go to SVN Repository view, 
    right click on "trunk", select Export...

2.  Export it to c:/temp/

3.  Rename trunk to php_ria_sdk_by_adobe

4.  Copy the /libraries directory over, or download the libraries that you need:
	1.  AMFPHP http://www.amfphp.org/ -> This goes in the libraries/amfphp/ directory.
		(ie. gateway.php is in libraries/amfphp/)
	2.  WebORB http://www.themidnightcoders.org -> This goes in the libraries/weborb/Weborb/ directory. 
	 	(ie. ORBHttpHandler.php is in libraries/weborb/Weborb/)
		Note that you need to make a change to the Weborb/WEB-INF/flex/services-config.xml file to point to a weborb.php  file, as per instructions at http://www.themidnightcoders.com/forum/default.aspx?g=posts&t=52 

4.  Zip the php_ria_sdk_by_adobe directory up into a .zip file with the name php_ria_sdk_by_adobe_YYMMDD.zip

5.  Profit.

6.  Upload to a test server to make sure things work properly.
