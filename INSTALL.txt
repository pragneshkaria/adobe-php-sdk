* To install the SDK, simply extract the .zip file to your webserver. It should extract 
to a directory php_ria_sdk_by_adobe.

* You'll need to create a new database called flextest if you'd like to use some of the
samples.  Create it using the following SQL commands:

CREATE DATABASE flextest;
USE flextest;

CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `userid` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `username` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL default '',
  `emailaddress` varchar(255) collate latin1_general_ci NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`userid`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_general_ci;


GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
on flextest.* to flext@localhost identified by 'p@ssword';

* In libraries/weborb/Services/MySQL.php
change the following lines to match your setup:

private $server = "localhost";
private $username = "root";
private $password = "";

Now open up php_ria_sdk_by_adobe/index.html in your web browser.
