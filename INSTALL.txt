* To install the SDK, simply extract the .zip file to your webserver. It should extract 
to a directory php_ria_sdk_by_adobe.

* You'll need to create a new database called flextest if you'd like to use some of the
samples.  Create it using the flextest.sql file in the samples/ directory.

* In libraries/weborb/Services/MySQL.php
change the following lines to match your setup:

private $server = "localhost";
private $username = "root";
private $password = "";

Now open up http://localhost/php_ria_sdk_by_adobe/index.html in your web browser.
